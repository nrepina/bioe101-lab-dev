    "\n",
    "-  A force-sensing resistor (FSR) is made of conductive polymer, which changes\n",
    "its conductance in a predictable manner when pressure is being applied on\n",
    "the surface. Typically, when we apply pressure on the active surface of a FSR,\n",
    "it exhibits a decrease in resistance. Sometimes, a FSR is designed for use in\n",
    "touch screens or panels on electronic devices.\n",

    "\n",
    "-  You will now calculate the nominal sensing resistance of your sensor. Note:\n",
    "Do not use the sensing/load resistance values from the datasheet in the next\n",
    "sections. Instead, calculate it empirically as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Use your breadboard and the Arduino’s DGND and 5V output terminals to\n",
    "build a voltage divider with your sensor and a 51kΩ resistor. Wire the 5V and\n",
    "ground terminals to the red/blue rails on the board, and then use those rails\n",
    "for powering your circuit. Configure your voltage divider so the FSR is\n",
    "connected to GND, and use an oscilloscope or the serial plotter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2:** What is the resistance of your FSR with an empty falcon tube placed on the\n",
    "sensor? With a 100g mass? Show your work. Sketch and label your circuit, and write\n",
    "down what weight you used.\n",
    "Pro-Tip: To help with consistency of your measurements, tape down the FSR and let the\n",

    "values for R1 (in the diagram below) that are as close as possible to the\n",
    "steady-state resistance of your FSR with no load, as determined in Question 2.\n",

    "- Connect Vc and Vd of your voltage divider to the two analog inputs (AI 0+\n",

    "\n",
    "- Standard objects (50 mL Falcon tubes containing different materials) have\n",
    "different weights. Determine the voltage differentials that correspond to these\n",
    "weights. Place the objects on your FSR one at a time, cap facing down, and\n",
    "record the differential voltage from your Wheatstone bridge. Assuming that\n",
    "the weight-differential voltage relationship is linear (in reality it isn’t, but\n",
    "we’ll just approximate it in a piecewise linear fashion), find the slope (change\n",
    "in voltage/change in weight) and y-intercept (voltage differential with no\n",
    "load).\n",
    "\n",

    "the sensor. To do this, you can use an Analog Output port of the MyDAQ\n",

    "up, as a small voltage (of e.g. 0.1V) is likely insufficient to power an LED and\n",

    "- In LabView, create a DAQAssist module and set it to Analog Output. The\n",
    "input into this output DAQ Assistant is the same waveform that you acquired\n",
    "from the AI 0+ and 0-. You will need to place boundaries on the signal from\n",
    "0-5V first, as the analog out of the MyDAQ cannot produce negative voltages.\n",
    "Verify that the brightness of the LED changes with varying pressure or\n",
    "weight sensed.\n",

    "sheet, pg. 32 (Audio example) on how to setup a DAQ Assistant Vis for\n",
    "simultaneous analog input and analog output. Although the example\n",
    "uses the audio input and output ports, the way the VI is designed is\n",
    "similar. Pay special attention to how the samples are acquired (number\n",

    "computer’s speakers, where the frequency is determined by pressure. Be creative!\n",
    "Attach a screenshot of your VI/block diagram and circuit board here if you had time to\n",
